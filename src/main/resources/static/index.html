                        A simple, small, FPGA inspired, breadboardable logic cell implemented with discrete SMD components. It is composed of a fracturable 4-input LUT and a D-type flip-flop. It can perform any 4-to-1 or 4-to-2 boolean function and it can optionally store the result in its flip-flop. Logi-Block is programmable serially and can be combined with others to implement any logic circuit.
